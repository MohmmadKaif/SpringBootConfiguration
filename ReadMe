Always have all your project package inside the base package.The base package is the package which is created when you create hte project.
For Example:In this project the base package name is com.example.SpringTest. And all other packages are inside this package.
This is beacause spring boot uses an auto configuration for component scanning, and thus component scanning starts from base package..
